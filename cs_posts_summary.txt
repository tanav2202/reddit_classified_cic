The Computer Science posts primarily revolve around student grievances and discussions. One major concern is the lack of clarity in coursework, particularly in Data Structures and Algorithms (CS201) where students express confusion regarding exam grading policies and the usefulness of certain topics in practical applications. Additionally, there are discussions about the difficulty level of Operating Systems (CS344), with students finding it challenging to grasp system calls and device drivers. There is also a recurring discussion about the insufficient resources provided for online learning, including outdated textbooks and lack of interactive learning materials. Lastly, some students have expressed concerns about the workload and time management challenges, suggesting the need for more flexible scheduling options.
